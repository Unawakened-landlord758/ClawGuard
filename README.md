## What it is

`ClawGuard` is the **security control layer for OpenClaw**.

If you are landing on this repository for the first time, the short version is:

> **ClawGuard is The antivirus for OpenClaw.**

It is designed to sit between OpenClaw and high-risk actions so users can:

- require human approval before risky actions continue,
- inspect and explain risky behavior,
- keep an audit trail,
- and gradually add protection across exec, outbound, and workspace-mutation paths.

## What works today

There is now a **first OpenClaw install demo** in this repository.

The current **first usable version** should be understood modestly:

- a **local install + smoke + fake-only demo package**
- enough to show the first plugin-hosted dashboard / checkup / approvals / audit / settings flow
- **not** a formal release, GA claim, or mature coverage statement

Today that demo covers:

- **risky `exec`**
- **minimal outbound coverage**
- **minimal workspace mutation coverage for `write` / `edit` / `apply_patch` actions**
- **plugin-hosted dashboard, checkup, approvals, audit, and settings pages** with:
  - browser-facing entry paths on `/clawguard*`
  - protected backing routes on `/plugins/clawguard/*`

Current Control UI posture:

- the plugin can already expose its own HTTP surfaces under `/plugins/clawguard/*`,
- but the current OpenClaw plugin API does **not** expose a formal way to register a left-nav tab such as **Security** inside the built-in Control UI,
- so the current demo should be understood as **plugin-owned pages entered through the public `/clawguard*` shell URLs**, not a first-class embedded dashboard tab. Any future embedded Control UI work would be a separate track requiring either a patched UI or upstream plugin-nav support that does not exist today.

Current repo status:

- the repo is still in a **docs-first + Sprint 0 code-bootstrap stage**,
- the installable OpenClaw path is currently a **demo baseline**, not a product release,
- and the demo is meant to show the first host integration and review flow, not a finished security platform.

## Install demo

The install-demo entry lives here:

- [`plugins/openclaw-clawguard/README.md`](./plugins/openclaw-clawguard/README.md)

Recommended install method from the repo root:

```powershell
openclaw plugins install .\plugins\openclaw-clawguard
```

Optional local tarball demo only:

```powershell
pnpm --dir plugins\openclaw-clawguard pack
openclaw plugins install .\plugins\openclaw-clawguard\<generated-tarball>.tgz
```

Important posture:

- this is an **install demo only**,
- it is **not published to a registry**,
- `@clawguard/clawguard` is currently **metadata only and still unpublished**,
- and this README does **not** imply npm publish, GA, or a formal release.

After install, restart OpenClaw, then use the plugin README operator runbook for the smoke path, 1-minute demo order, and 3-minute demo order. The current smoke path is:

- run `openclaw dashboard --no-open`
- replace the official tokenized dashboard URL path with `/clawguard`
- then move through:
  - `/clawguard`
  - `/clawguard/checkup`
  - `/clawguard/approvals`
  - `/clawguard/audit`
  - `/clawguard/settings`

## Demo scenarios

The current public-demo-ready scenarios are intentionally narrow:

1. **Risky exec**
   - ClawGuard blocks or queues a risky action for approval.
   - The decision is visible in the approvals page and the result lands in audit.
2. **Minimal outbound**
   - The demo shows the first outbound review / block posture.
   - Host-level outbound coverage is still intentionally limited.
3. **Minimal workspace mutation**
   - Risky file-change flows can enter the same approval / audit path.
   - In the current demo surface, `write` / `edit` / `apply_patch` are all explained as workspace mutation actions.
4. **Plugin-hosted operator flow**
   - Dashboard, checkup, approvals, audit, and settings pages provide the current demo surface.

For storytelling, the north-star scenario remains:

> **A group message tries to make OpenClaw send money, and ClawGuard puts the final decision back in human hands.**

But the repository demo should currently be understood as a **local install + page smoke + fake-only safety flow**, not as proof of real payment execution, real money movement, or broad runtime completeness.

## Current limitations

Please read this repo with the current scope in mind:

- **install demo only**
- **local path install is the recommended path**
- **local tarball is optional and local-only**
- **not published**
- **not a formal release**
- **not presented as GA or a complete product**
- **outbound coverage is still minimal**
- **host-level outbound keeps hard blocks on `message_sending` and closes allowed / failed delivery on `message_sent`, while tool-level approvals stay on `message` / `sessions_send`; these are still two minimal fake-only review points, not full outbound lifecycle coverage**
- **the approval loop is still a pending-action + allow-once-retry demo flow**
- **the built-in Control UI sidebar is currently core-owned and hard-coded; there is no official plugin nav registration API for a `Security` tab yet**
- **current browser entry relies on the public shell at `/clawguard*`, while the protected `/plugins/clawguard/*` routes remain implementation backing routes**
- **embedded Control UI work is explicitly out of scope for this first usable version; any future embedded option would still require either a custom/patched Control UI nav item or an upstream OpenClaw plugin-nav API that does not exist today**
- **the demo should not be read as real dangerous execution, real transfer / red-packet execution, or full release-grade validation**
